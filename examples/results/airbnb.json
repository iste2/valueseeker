      "shortLifeCycleBrands": {
        "score": 1,
        "reasoning": "While Airbnb maintains a strong brand presence, their service is not frequently purchased like FMCG products. Travel accommodations are occasional purchases with longer consideration cycles.",
        "examples": [
          "Business shows clear seasonality with Q1-Q3 peaks",
          "No single city represents more than 2% of revenue, indicating sporadic usage per location"

      "essentialProducts": {
        "score": 2,
        "reasoning": "While accommodation is necessary for travel, Airbnb's specific service is not essential as multiple alternatives exist. However, they have established themselves as a significant player in the travel accommodation sector.",
        "examples": [
          "Competes with hotels, OTAs, and property management companies",

      },
      "regulationDriven": {
        "score": 1,
        "reasoning": "While heavily regulated, demand for Airbnb's services is primarily driven by voluntary travel choices rather than legal requirements or mandatory events. Unlike insurance or safety equipment, their services are discretionary.",
        "examples": [
          "Primary demand drivers are leisure and business travel choices",

        "score": 2,
        "reasoning": "Not primarily competing on cost leadership but on unique inventory and experiences. Focuses more on value proposition than being the lowest-cost provider.",
